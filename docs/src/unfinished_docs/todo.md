# Todo list

## High priority

- [ ] add balanced growth path handling
- [ ] handle SS case where there are equations which have no information for the SS. use SS definitions in parameter block to complete system
- [ ] weed out SS solver and saved objects
- [ ] streamline estimation part (dont do string matching... but rely on precomputed indices...)
- [ ] change docs to reflect that the output of irfs include aux vars and also the model info Base.show includes aux vars
- [ ] catch cases where you define calibration equation without declaring conditional variable
- [ ] check out Aqua.jl as additional tests
- [ ] write functions to debug (fix_SS.jl...)
- [ ] parser model into per equation functions instead of single big functions
- [ ] model compression -> model setup as maximisation problem (gEcon) -> HANK models
- [ ] add other outputs from estimation (smoothed, filter states and shocks)
- [ ] implement global solution methods
- [ ] add more models
- [ ] plot multiple solutions or models - multioptions in one graph
- [ ] write tests and documentation for solution, estimation... making sure results are consistent
- [ ] write documentation/docstrings

- [ ] use @assert for errors and @test_throws
- [ ] print SS dependencies, show SS solver
- [ ] speed up 2nd moment calc for large models. maybe its only the derivatives but its slow for SW03
- [ ] make the nonnegativity trick optional
- [ ] get parameters (in function of parameters) into the dependencies
- [ ] for larger models write a model compression. gradient loglikelihood is very slow due to large matmuls
- [ ] see if we can avoid try catch and test for invertability instead
- [ ] use packages for kalman filter
- [ ] clean up different parameter types
- [ ] clean up printouts/reporting
- [ ] clean up function inputs and harmonise AD and standard commands
- [ ] figure out combinations for inputs (parameters and variables in different formats for get_irf for example)
- [ ] Find any SS by optimising over both SS guesses and parameter inputs
- [ ] have Flux solve SS field
- [ ] check control flow in SS solver
  
- [x] try eval instead of runtimegeneratedfunctions; eval is slower but can be typed
- [x] check correctness of solution for models added
- [x] SpecialFunctions eta and gamma cause conflicts; consider importing used functions explicitly
- [x] bring the parsing of equations after the parameters macro
- [x] rewrite redundant var part so that it works with ss_aux_equations instead of ss_equations
- [x] catch cases where ss vars are set to zero. x[0] * eps_z[x] in SS becomes x[0] * 0 but should be just 0 (use sympy for this)
- [x] remove duplicate nonnegative aux vars to speed up SS solver
- [x] error when defining variable more than once in parameters macro
- [x] consolidate aux vars, use sympy to simplify
- [x] error when writing equations with only one variable
- [x] error when defining variable as parameter
- [x] more options for IRFs, simulate only certain shocks - set stds to 0 instead
- [x] add NBTOOLBOX, IRIS to overview
- [x] input field for SS init guess in all functions #not necessary so far. SS solver works out everything just fine
- [x] symbolic derivatives
- [x] check SW03 SS solver
- [x] more options for IRFs, pass on shock vector
- [x] write to dynare
- [x] add plot for policy function
- [x] add plot for FEVD
- [x] add functions like get_variance, get_sd, get_var, get_covar
- [x] add correlation, autocorrelation, and (conditional) variance decomposition
- [x] go through docs to reflect verbose behaviour
- [x] speed up covariance mat calc
- [x] have conditional parameters at end of entry as well (... | alpha instead of alpha | ...)
- [x] Get functions: get_output, get_moments
- [x] get rid of init_guess
- [x] an and schorfheide estimation
- [x] estimation, IRF matching, system priors
- [x] check derivative tests with finite diff
- [x] release first version
- [x] SS solve: add domain transformation optim
- [x] revisit optimizers for SS
- [x] figure out licenses
- [x] SS: replace variables in log() with auxilliary variable which must be positive to help solver
- [x] complex example with lags > 1, [ss], calib equations, aux nonneg vars
- [x] add NLboxsolve
- [x] try NonlinearSolve - fails due to missing bounds
- [x] make noneg aux part of optim problem for NLboxsolve in order to avoid DomainErrors - not necessary
- [x] have bounds on alpha (failed previously due to naming conflict) - works now

## Not high priority

- [ ] estimation codes with missing values (adopt kalman filter)
- [ ] whats a good error measure for higher order solutions (taking whole dist of future shock into account)? use mean error for n number of future shocks
- [ ] improve redundant calculations of SS and other parts of solution
- [ ] restructure functions and containers so that compiler knows what types to expect
- [ ] use RecursiveFactorization and TriangularSolve to solve, instead of MKL or OpenBLAS
- [ ] fix SnoopCompile with generated functions
- [ ] rewrite first order with riccati equation MatrixEquations.jl
- [ ] exploit variable incidence and compression for higher order derivatives
- [ ] for estimation use CUDA with st order: linear time iteration starting from last 1st order solution and then LinearSolveCUDA solvers for higher orders. this should bring benefits for large models and HANK models
- [ ] test on highly [nonlinear model](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165188917300970)
- [ ] pull request in StatsFuns to have norminv... accept type numbers and add translation from matlab: norminv to StatsFuns norminvcdf
- [ ] more informative errors when declaring equations/ calibration
- [ ] unit equation errors
- [ ] implenent reduced linearised system solver + nonlinear
- [ ] implement HANK
- [ ] implement automatic problem derivation (gEcon)

- [ ] select variables for moments

- [x] conditional forecasting
